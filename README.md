### Hi there, I'm Lukas 👋

🚀 My journey started off in Python, where I was made small scripts, graphical user interfaces and eventually experimented with APIs like Discord, which taught me the fundamentals of programming.

☕ I then moved onto Java which helped me develop with an object oriented mindset and laid the groundwork for structuring and developing larger scale projects. I deployed my first project using Java which was a Discord bot 🎉!

📱 Kotlin becamse my new focus after being introduced to it as a better and safer alternative to Java, which then led me to developing and deploying Android native applications using Jetback Compose and Ktor. I'm interested in multiplatform (iOS and Android) mobile development using Kotlin. 

👨‍💻 While Kotlin is great for many things, I found limitations when experimenting with Kotlin/JS, which led me into learning about web development. Out of all the popular frameworks, Svelte (and SvelteKit) resonated with me the most and became my primary choice of framework, though I do have experience with Vue (with Nuxt) and React (with Next.js) too.

🦀 I'm now currently learning and exploring Rust in my free time. The promise for performance, robustness and safety is what drew me in, as well as its unique approach to memory management, error management and strong type system (which is a little similar to Kotlin sealed interfaces).
